# Sklearn ML Project with Streamlit

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

In this project, I used different classification algorithms such as XGBoost, Linear Regression and Random Forests. By using 3 different datasets, this Streamlit application has been created.

The live Sklearn ML Project App is [here](https://share.streamlit.io/berkayalan/sklearn-with-streamlit/main/main.py).
